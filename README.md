In the project we consider the positive-unlabelled multi-label scenario in which multiple target variables are not observed directly. Instead, we observe surrogate variables indicating  whether the   target variables are labelled  or not. The presence of the label means that the  variable is positive. The absence of the label  means that the  variable can be either positive or negative. We analyse embedded feature selection methods based on two weighted penalized empirical risk minimization frameworks. 
In the first method, we introduce weights of observations. The idea is to assign larger weights to observations for which there is a consistency between the values of the true target variable and the corresponding surrogate variable. In the second method, we consider  weighted empirical risk function which corresponds to the risk function for the true unobserved target variables. The weights in both methods depend on the unknown propensity score functions whose estimation is a challenging problem. We propose to use very simple bounds for propensity score which  leads to relatively simple forms of weights. In the experiments we analyse the predictive power of the considered methods for different labelling schemes.
